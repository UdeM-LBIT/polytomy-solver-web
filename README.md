Polytomy Solver (Web application)
==============================

Web application for various LBIT phylogenetic algorithms.
Largely based on the ETE2 toolkit (http://ete.cgenomics.org/).

See it in action at : https://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/~seguinjo/polytomysolver.html

## Notes

Extends the base WSGI ETE2 web application. Wrapped and structured as a CGI python application due to hosting environment constraits.
